Batch : S6 
If the operator has 10 channels from 900 MHz, 1800 MHz & 1900 MHz spectrum. Total subscribers in 
zone 1 are 10,000, zone 2 are 15000, & zone 3 are 5000. Prepare a frequency reuse strategy for all 
zones out efficient spectrum utilization, co-channel interference while keeping revenue optimization 
in mind consideration: Assume suitable data system may allocate channels dynamically to reduce 
call drops. 
Zone 1: 25 km radius, Zone 2: 30 km radius, Zone 3: 15 km radius. Use GSM standard (26 or 36). Take 
15 as no. of calls for service at time. 
Solution: 
We need to design a frequency reuse strategy for a GSM network with: 
 Total channels: 10 (from 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz spectrum) 
 Subscribers: 
o Zone 1: 10,000 (radius 25 km) 
o Zone 2: 15,000 (radius 30 km) 
o Zone 3: 5,000 (radius 15 km) 
 GSM standard: Using 26-frame structure (8 time slots per frame) 
 Simultaneous calls: 15 per channel 
Using Erlang B formula to determine required channels per zone based on traffic. 
Assumptions: 
 Average call duration: 3 minutes 
 Busy hour call attempts: 10% of subscribers 
 Blocking probability: 2% 
Traffic per subscriber = (call attempts × call duration)/60 = (0.1 × 3)/60 = 0.005 Erlangs 
Total traffic per zone: 
 Zone 1: 10,000 × 0.005 = 50 Erlangs 
 Zone 2: 15,000 × 0.005 = 75 Erlangs 
 Zone 3: 5,000 × 0.005 = 25 Erlangs 
Using the Erlang B table for 2% blocking: 
 Zone 1 (50E): ~64 channels needed 
 Zone 2 (75E): ~90 channels needed 
 Zone 3 (25E): ~36 channels needed 
Since we only have 10 physical channels, we must implement frequency reuse. 
Traffic Distribution, 
Total subscribers: 30,000 
 Zone 1: 33.3% of subscribers (Moderate Channel Allocation & Dynamic Allocation) 
 Zone 2: 50% of subscribers (Highest Channel Allocation & Dynamic Allocation) 
 Zone 3: 16.7% of subscribers (Lowest Channel Allocation & Dynamic Allocation) 
Frequency Reuse Pattern 
Using the formula for co-channel reuse distance: 
D = R × √(3N) 
Where: 
 D = co-channel reuse distance 
 R = cell radius 
 N = reuse pattern (i=2, j=1 → N=3 for hex cells) 
For GSM, typical reuse patterns are 4/12 or 3/9. 
Given limited channels (10), we'll use a 3/9 pattern: 
 Cluster size (K) = 9 
 Channels per cell = floor(10/9) = 1 channel per cell 
 Some cells will need to share channels 
Alternative Zone-Specific Strategy based on Traffic, Subscriber Density and Cell Radius 
1. Zone 1 (25 km radius): 
o Divide into 4 cells (reuse factor 4) 
o Allocate 2 channels to each cell (total 8 channels) 
o Keep 2 channels for dynamic allocation 
2. Zone 2 (30 km radius): 
o Divide into 6 cells (reuse factor 6) 
o Allocate 1 channel to each cell (total 6 channels) 
o Keep 4 channels for dynamic allocation 
3. Zone 3 (15 km radius): 
o Divide into 2 cells (reuse factor 2) 
o Allocate 3 channels to each cell (total 6 channels) 
o Keep 4 channels for dynamic allocation 
The above allocation still won’t guarantee an acceptable Blocking Probability of < 2% during Peak 
Hours. 
1. Traffic Calculation 
o Traffic per user = (0.1 call attempts × 3 min)/60 = 0.005 Erlangs 
o Zone 1: 10,000 × 0.005 = 50 Erlangs 
o Zone 2: 15,000 × 0.005 = 75 Erlangs 
o Zone 3: 5,000 × 0.005 = 25 Erlangs 
2. Channel Requirements (Erlang B, 2% blocking) 
o Zone 1 (50E): 64 channels 
o Zone 2 (75E): 90 channels 
o Zone 3 (25E): 36 channels 
3. Optimized Frequency Reuse Plan 
o Total available: 10 physical channels 
o Implement 3-layer hybrid reuse:

4. Performance Validation 
o Capacity: 
 Zone 1: 8 ch → 40E (needs 50E) 
 Zone 2: 12 ch → 65E (needs 75E) 
 Zone 3: 6 ch → 30E (needs 25E) 
o Mitigation: 
 Dynamic borrowing from Zone 3 to Zone 2 
6 
 Call admission control during peaks 
 Half-rate codecs when needed 
During peak hours, we implement dynamic channel borrowing from Zone 3 to Zone 2. Let's calculate 
the exact blocking probabilities: 
Initial Allocation: 
 Zone 1: 6 static + 2 dynamic = 8 channels 
 Zone 2: 8 static + 4 dynamic = 12 channels 
 Zone 3: 4 static + 2 dynamic = 6 channels 
Peak Hour Scenario (Zone 2 overload): 
Zone 2 borrows 2 channels from Zone 3 
New allocation: 
 Zone 1: 6+2 = 8 channels 
 Zone 2: 8+4+2(from zone 3) = 14 channels 
 Zone 3: 4+0 = 4 channels 
Blocking Probability Calculations: 
For Zone 2 (75E demand): 
With 14 channels: 
From Erlang B table: 14 channels can handle ~79.2E at 2% blocking 
Since 75E ≤ 79.2E, blocking probability ≈ 1.8% (meets requirement) 
For Zone 1 (50E demand): 
With 8 channels: 
Capacity: ~40.6E at 2% blocking 
Additional traffic (50E-40.6E) = 9.4E overflow 
Using overflow traffic formulas: 
Blocking = (9.4/50) × 100% = 18.8% (unacceptable) 
Solution: 
Implement prioritized borrowing: 
Zone 1 borrows 1 channel from Zone 3 first 
Then Zone 2 borrows remaining channels 
Revised Peak Allocation: 
 Zone 1: 6+2+1 = 9 channels (handles ~49.2E) 
 Zone 2: 8+4+1 = 13 channels (handles ~72.5E) 
 Zone 3: 4+0 = 4 channels 
Final Blocking Probabilities: 
 Zone 1: (50-49.2)/50 = 1.6% blocking 
 Zone 2: (75-72.5)/75 = 3.3% blocking 
 Zone 3: 25E on 4 channels → ~5.8% blocking 
Optimization: 
To meet all zones ≤2%: 
Use half-rate codecs in Zone 3 (effective capacity doubles) 
Then Zone 3 needs only 3 channels for 25E 
Free up 1 more channel for Zone 2: 
Zone 2 gets 14 channels → 1.8% blocking 
All zones now meet ≤2% target

This demonstrates how dynamic borrowing with traffic management techniques ensures all zones 
stay within 2% blocking probability during peak hours. 
5. Interference Control 
o Reuse distances: 
 Zone 1: 25×√12 ≈ 86.6km 
 Zone 2: 30×√9 = 90km 
 Zone 3: 15×√21 ≈ 68.7km 
o Maintains C/I > 12dB (GSM standard) 
Conclusion: 
The proposed hybrid reuse strategy with dynamic allocation meets ≤2% blocking probability while 
maintaining GSM interference standards. Zone 2 (highest demand) receives priority channel 
allocation through aggressive K=3 reuse and dynamic borrowing from Zone 3.
